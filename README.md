# React Redux Base

## Npm commands
1. **Run the app**. `yarn start` or `npm start`
2. **Build the app**. `yarn build` or `npm run build`
3. **Lint the app**. `yarn lint` or `npm run lint`
4. **Test the app**. `yarn test` or `npm run test`

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Create two constants files in `./src` folder(devConstant.js and prodConstants.js):
  * devConstants is used while you are developing(on `npm start` script)
  * prodConstats is used once you build the app(on `npm run build` script)

  Those files should include the `API_URL` constant.

  devConstants.js or prodConstants.js example:
  ```javascript
  export const config = {
    API_URL: 'http://your-api-url.com'
  };
  ```
4. Start the dev server: `yarn start` or `npm start -s`

## Initial Machine Setup
**Install [Node 4.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)** - (6.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance). Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

**Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)** - Fast, reliable, and secure package manager

## Deploying to AWS S3
1. **Install [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)**
2. **Configure AWS** with the command `aws configure`
3. **Set the buckets for your app** in the script `/tools/deployS3.js`
4. **Run the command to deploy** `npm run deploy:staging` or `npm run deploy:production`
